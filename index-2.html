                    <p>Shepard Fairey, born as Frank Shepard Fairey on February 15, 1970 in Charleston, SC.  He graduated from Idyllwild School of Music &amp; the Arts in 1988, located in Idyllwild.  He was accepted into the prestigious Rhode Island School of Design and graduated in 1992.</p>

                    <p>While attending RISD, Shepard was a part-time employee at a skateboard shop.  Which was fitting to his lifestyle as a skateboarder himself.  In 1989, a friend of his had asked him how to create a stencil.  This is when Shepard grabbed the image of Andre the Giant and created "Andre the Giant has a posse".  He took these stencils and stickers to the streets.  Andre the Giant gained grounded and Faireys name was launched.  Later on, Fairey decided to change up the image by keeping Andre the Giant and placing OBEY in bold red at the bottom of the image.  The OBEY campaign was born.  What was the meaning behind it?  It was stated to simply have people question everthing they are inundated with.  In 2001 OBEY clothing was officially launched.</p>
    
                    <p>Shepard Fairey's art and message calls out for social and political change.  His involvement has included:</p>
    
                        <ul style="list-style-type:square">
                            <li>protested the Iraq War</li>
                            <li>supported Occupy Wall Street</li>
                            <li>advocated gun control</li>
                            <li>advocated environmental protection</li>

                    <p>The creation of the HOPE poster in 2008 made a significant impact on Barack Obama's presidential campaign as well as on Shepard's career, catapaulting him into international status.  This particular poster now has a lasting place in history.  The Smithsonian even obtained a copy of the portrait for their collection.  His art is distictly political in which he supports social causes and opposes corporate influence.  In 2011 Shepard's art made the cover of Time Magazine's Person of the Year.</p>
    
                    <p>Shepard Fairey is also a consistent contributor to several different charities. Here is a list of just a few:</p>
                        <ul style="list-style-type:square">
                            <li>Chiapas Relief Fund</li>
                            <li>American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)</li>
                            <li>Feeding America</li>
                            <li>Art of Elysium</li>
                            <li>Give to Cure</li>
                        </ul>
    
                    <p>Currently, in 2017, there has been no slowing down for Shepard Fairey.  He has released the "We The People" series.  Featuring portraits of Native Americans, African Americans, Muslims and Latinas with slogans such as "Defend Dignity" and "Women are Perfect".  These prints spread throughout the nation and encouraged to be used during the Women's March.  OBEY clothing stated that although they have always researched diligently and chosen to work with manufacturers who provide a fair wage and ethical working contitions, they have recently taken the next step in becoming an officail FAIR TRADE USA partner. Shepard has also released the latest <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2017/04/27/shepard-fairey-and-ai-weiwei-on-using-art-to-fight-president-trump.html" target="_blank"> "No Future"</a> deck series of limited edition skateboard decks in response to Trumps first 100 days as president. The title of "No Future" was inspired by lyrics from the Sex Pistols.</p>

                    <p>As long as there is social turmoil and politial strife, Shepard Fairey will always be around providing us with meaningful and beautiful artwork. "In terms of achieving what I’d like to achieve with my art—which is to encourage someone to think about an issue in a way they may not have—finding evocative imagery and symbols that can translate complex ideas in relatable ways is far more challenging than making portraits. At the same time, there may be no more effective means of impacting things—socially, politically, and conceptually—than portraits that potentially appeal in a more shallow way. Don’t get me wrong; I love the superficial as much as the next person, but I also like to weave in substance" (quote by Shepard Fairey in a November 2016 conversation with <a href="https://thecreativeindependent.com/people/shepard-fairey-on-political-art/" target="_blank">The Creative Independant</a>).</p>
